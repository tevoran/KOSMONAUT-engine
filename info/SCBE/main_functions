Welcome to the Star Battle Command Engine description.


In this document I will explain the main functions that are provided by the Star Battle Command game engine.

The engine is written in C, due to the lack of easily accessible 3d game engines for C. Sadly the vast majority
is written in C++, which is an issue if you want to stick strictly to C. So this engine uses SDL2 and, as a
difference to most relevant 3d game engines in C, it uses modern OpenGL. The currently used version of OpenGL
is 4.5.

Currently the functionality of the engine is still restricted but there are following important functions:

int engine_init()

void gfx_new_frame()

void gfx_create_camera(struct vec3f position, struct vec2f view_direction, float far_z, float fov)

void gfx_camera_location(struct vec3f position)
