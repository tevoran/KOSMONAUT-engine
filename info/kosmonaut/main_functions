Welcome to the Star Battle Command Engine description.


In this document I will explain the main functions that are provided by the kosmonaut game engine.

The engine is written in C, due to the lack of easily accessible 3d game engines for C. Sadly the vast majority
is written in C++, which is an issue if you want to stick strictly to C. So this engine uses SDL2, NNG and, as a
difference to a lot 3d game engines in C, it uses modern OpenGL. The currently used version of OpenGL
is 4.5.

Currently the functionality of the engine is still restricted but there are following important functions:

ENGINE FUNCTIONS

int engine_init(char *window_name, char *config_file)

void engine_log(char *logged_text, ...)

struct config engine_config_state()

void gfx_new_frame()

CAMERA FUNCTIONS

void gfx_create_camera(struct vec3f position, float far_z, float fov)

void gfx_camera_location(struct vec3f position)

void gfx_camera_rotate(float rotation, struct vec3f rot_axis)

MODEL FUNCTIONS

struct model* gfx_create_triangle(
	struct vec3f location,
	struct vec3f corner1, 
	struct vec3f corner2, 
	struct vec3f color)

struct model* gfx_create_cube(
	struct vec3f location, 
	struct vec3f color, 
	float size)

struct model* gfx_load_model(char *file_location, struct vec3f location)

void gfx_model_load_texture(char *file_location, struct model *model)

UI FUNCTIONS

struct ui_element* gfx_ui_create_window(struct vec2f position, struct vec2f size)

struct ui_font* gfx_ui_load_font(char *file_location, uint32_t num_characters)

struct model* gfx_ui_printf(float pos_x, float pos_y, struct ui_font *font, int font_size, const char *text, ...)



DESCRIPTION OF THESE FUNCTIONS

ENGINE FUNCTIONS

int engine_init(char *window_name, char *config_file)

This function initializes the engine and takes a string with with the intended name of the game window and
another string with the adress of the engine configuration file. This configuration file contains information
like the used resolution.


void engine_log(char *logged_text, ...)

The engine_log function is used for saving a log message to the log file, which was specified in the config
file.


struct config engine_config_state()

engine_config_state() returns a struct with the current setting of the kosmonaut game engine. You can read the
resolution or the location of the log file with this struct.


void gfx_new_frame()

gfx_new_frame() is used for drawing everything onto the window. It also clears the framebuffer for the next
frame. 



CAMERA FUNCTIONS

void gfx_create_camera(struct vec3f position, float far_z, float fov)

It is also not surprising what this function does. It creates a camera at a certain location with a certain
maximum viewing distance as a float in far_z. It also needs a field of view in radians. Without this function
there is nothing that can be seen.


void gfx_camera_location(struct vec3f position)

This sets the camera to a certain location.


void gfx_camera_rotate(float rotation, struct vec3f rot_axis)

This function rotates the camera around a free rotation axis with a certain rotation. The rotation axis can
be chosen freely. And different rotations will always be added upon another.



MODEL AND OBJECT RELATED FUNCTIONS

struct model* gfx_create_triangle(
	struct vec3f location,
	struct vec3f corner1, 
	struct vec3f corner2, 
	struct vec3f color)


Used for the creation of a triangle at a location with two corners as offsets to its location. Additionally
the triangle has a color.


struct model* gfx_create_quad(
	struct vec3f location, 
	struct vec3f corner1, 
	struct vec3f corner2, 
	struct vec3f color) 

Creates a rectangle.


struct model* gfx_create_cube(
	struct vec3f location, 
	struct vec3f color, 
	float size)

The function creates a cube around a central location in a certain color with a certain size.


struct model* gfx_load_model(char *file_location, struct vec3f location)

This creates a model from a model that is stored in a file. Currently only .obj files are supported.


struct model* gfx_copy_model(struct model* entry_address)

If a model is loaded via gfx_load_model then it can be copied and used over and over again with the function
gfx_copy_model. The function returns another model struct pointer, which can be used regularly.


void gfx_update_model_location(struct model* model, struct vec3f location)

Sets a model or primitive to a certain location inside the world.


void gfx_model_rotate(struct model* model, float rotation, struct vec3f rot_axis)

Rotates the model or primitive around a rotation axis by the radian given.


void gfx_model_load_texture(char *file_location, struct model *model)

The function loads a texture from a file and adds it to a model or primitive that was given in the function.


UI FUNCTIONS

struct ui_element* gfx_ui_create_window(struct vec2f position, struct vec2f size)

A function for creating a window on the screen at a specific location on the screen. The coordinates are relative to
the screen size. So a position like 0.0f, 0.0f is at the left bottom corner of the screen while 0.5f, 0.5f is exactly
the middle of the screen. This is always the same regardless of the the chosen resolution.


struct ui_font* gfx_ui_load_font(char *file_location, uint32_t num_characters)

With this function it is possible to read a bitmap file that contains characters. It returns a pointer that can be used
when printing text on the screen. So it is possible to choose between different fonts at the same time.


struct model* gfx_ui_printf(float pos_x, float pos_y, struct ui_font *font, int font_size_pt, const char *text, ...)

Finally a function for printing text onto the screen. It can be used as printf() but with some additional functionality.
Therefore it is possible to choose the size of the text, the font and its relative location on the screen.
