The config file contains important information for the engine to run.
There are several possible commands for the config file. And it is only
possible to have one command per line. Everything after the first command
in a line gets ignored. The commands are:


resx

resy

wireframe

resx

The resx command sets the resolution in x direction to a certain value.
An example would be "resx=1920". This sets the resolution to 1920 pixels
in x direction.


resy

The resy command sets the resolution in y direction to a certain value.
An example would be "resy=1080". This sets the resolution to 1080 pixels
in y direction.


wireframe

If this command is used then everything is rendered in wireframe mode instead
of the regular rendering
